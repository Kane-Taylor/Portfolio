# Kane  Taylor
I am a hard-working and enthusiastic software developer, skilled in teamwork and communication. Seeking to further build on existing programming and design knowledge gained from working at Origen, university and side projects.
Inside this repository you will find some of the projects I worked on at university or in my own spare time.
